                    I am a dedicated and curious Web Developer with strong hands-on experience gained through academic projects and self-initiated development work.<br />
                    Having recently completed a comprehensive .NET Web Developer program, I’ve built a skill set equivalent to two years of practical experience through intensive, project-based learning.<br />
                    My expertise spans full-stack development using C#, ASP.NET, and modern JavaScript frameworks such as React, Next.js, and Node.js.<br/>
                    I have developed responsive web applications, implemented database-first solutions using SQL Server and MySQL, and utilized Azure for cloud deployment and CI/CD pipelines.<br />
                    I am proficient in building front-end interfaces with React (including React Hooks), TypeScript, Vite, and Blazor, and in developing cross-platform applications using WPF and .NET MAUI.<br />
                    I also have experience with microservices architecture and CMS integration (Umbraco).<br />
                    In addition, I actively explore AI tools and automation workflows to improve development efficiency and user engagement.<br />
                    With a background in customer support and team collaboration, I bring strong communication skills, adaptability, and a passion for continuous learning.<br />
                    I am eager to contribute to forward-thinking development teams and help build scalable, modern web solutions.<br />
